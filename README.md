# CallScout

**Live Demo: [https://call-scout.vercel.app](https://call-scout.vercel.app)**

**Real-Time Earnings Call Insight** — AI-powered analysis for investors, analysts, and learners.

> Make earnings calls understandable — for everyone.

**Problem:** Earnings calls are dense, fast-paced, and filled with jargon, making it difficult for even seasoned investors to extract key insights in real time. Reading 60-page transcripts after the call is too slow in a fast-moving market.

**Solution:** CallScout provides a live, annotated transcript of earnings calls. As the call happens, our AI analyst listens, analyzes, and delivers concise, material insights directly alongside the transcript, turning complex financial discussions into clear, actionable intelligence.

This project is a submission for the **[✰ LIVE AI Lone Star 2025](https://liveai-lonestar-2025.devpost.com/)** hackathon.

## Features

- **Live Audio Streaming**: Real-time HLS audio playback synchronized with a dynamic transcript.
- **Word-by-Word Transcription**: Live transcript display with precise word-level timing.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: As the call progresses, our AI financial analyst generates insights for meaningful segments.
- **Smart Scrolling**: The transcript auto-scrolls with the live audio, with manual override and a "jump to live" button.
- **Responsive Design**: A modern, clean UI with dark/light mode support, built for any device.
- **High-Quality Analysis**: Insights are generated by a fine-tuned prompt that directs the AI to focus on materially significant information.
- **Performant**: Call pages are statically generated for speed, and insights are generated using the fast `o4-mini` model.

## How It Works

CallScout is built around a segment-based insight generation strategy. This ensures a clean and predictable user experience.

1.  **Live Ingestion**: The application ingests a live HLS audio stream and a time-coded transcript file.
2.  **Segment Processing**: The transcript is parsed into segments (sentences or logical blocks).
3.  **Completion Detection**: The system monitors the audio playback and determines when a segment has been fully spoken.
4.  **AI Analysis**: Once a segment is complete, it's sent to our AI insight API. The API receives the current segment and the history of the conversation for context.
5.  **Insight Generation**: The API uses OpenAI's `o4-mini` model with a sophisticated prompt that mimics a financial analyst. The AI decides if the segment contains a material insight and, if so, generates a concise analysis.
6.  **Display**: The generated insight appears directly below its corresponding transcript segment in the UI.

This approach provides one high-quality insight per meaningful segment, avoiding noise and information overload.

## AI Insight API

CallScout's core is the AI-powered insight generation system.

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/generate-insight`

This endpoint analyzes a transcript segment and returns a potential insight.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "conversationHistory": "Everything said before the current segment...",
  "currentSentence": "The complete segment text that was just spoken.",
  "timestamp": "12:30",
  "segmentId": "seg_123"
}
```

**Response (Success with Insight):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "insight": {
    "id": "insight_1749382488495_kbhfxydjb",
    "text": "Cash flow improvements suggest better working capital management.",
    "segmentId": "seg_123",
    "createdAt": "2025-06-08T11:34:48.495Z"
  },
  "meta": {
    "processingTimeMs": 850,
    "timestamp": "2025-06-08T11:34:48.496Z"
  }
}
```

**Response (Success without Insight):**
If the AI determines the segment is not insightful, the `insight` field will be omitted.
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "meta": {
    "processingTimeMs": 450,
    "timestamp": "2025-06-08T11:35:12.123Z"
  }
}
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

- **Audio**: HLS.js for live audio streaming
- **AI**: OpenAI API (`o4-mini`) for insight generation
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Testing the API

You can test the API endpoints locally.

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/generate-insight

# Generate an insight for a segment
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate-insight \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "conversationHistory": "In the previous quarter, we faced significant headwinds in our supply chain, impacting our margins.",
    "currentSentence": "However, this quarter, we've successfully localized our supply chains, which has already resulted in a 200 basis point improvement in gross margin.",
    "timestamp": "15:46",
    "segmentId": "seg_test_1"
  }'
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can navigate to a specific call, for example: [http://localhost:3000/call/tesla-q1-2025](http://localhost:3000/call/tesla-q1-2025)
