## New: AI Insight API

CallScout now includes an AI-powered insight system that automatically analyzes completed sentences and generates relevant insights.

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/generate-insight`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "conversationHistory": "Everything said before the current segment",
  "currentSentence": "The complete segment text that was just spoken", 
  "timestamp": "12:30",
  "segmentId": "seg_123",
  "sentenceStartTime": 750.5,
  "sentenceEndTime": 753.2
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "insight": {
    "id": "insight_1749382488495_kbhfxydjb",
    "startTime": "12:30",
    "endTime": "12:37",
    "text": "Cash flow improvements suggest better working capital management.",
    "segmentId": "seg_123",
    "createdAt": "2025-06-08T11:34:48.495Z"
  },
  "meta": {
    "processingTimeMs": 0,
    "timestamp": "2025-06-08T11:34:48.496Z"
  }
}
```

### Insight Types

AI generates contextual insights covering various topics including financial metrics, strategic initiatives, market analysis, operational updates, and management commentary.

### How It Works

1. **Real-time Analysis**: As the audio plays and transcript appears word by word
2. **Segment Completion Detection**: System identifies when a transcript segment is fully completed
3. **Post-Segment Processing**: Calls insight API once per segment after completion
4. **Dual Context**: API receives both:
   - **Current Segment**: The complete segment text with exact timing
   - **Conversation History**: Everything said before this segment
5. **Accurate Timing**: Insights use segment start/end times from audio
6. **One Insight Per Segment**: Each segment can have at most one insight
7. **Live Insights**: 50% chance of generating insights that appear immediately

### Segment-Based Insight Strategy

**Approach**: One insight per completed segment for clean, predictable UX.

#### üîç **Segment Completion Processing**
- Wait for transcript segments to be fully completed (2 seconds after last word)
- Process each segment once with its complete content
- Generate at most one insight per segment

#### üéØ **Simple Visual Design**
- **Clean Indicators**: Single AI badge per segment when insight exists
- **Inline Display**: Insights appear directly below their segment
- **Consistent Layout**: No complex counting or grouping needed

#### üìä **UI Elements**

**In Transcript Segments:**
```
üî¥ [Live indicator] ü§ñ AI ‚Üê Simple indicator when insight exists
```

**Insight Display:**
```
[Segment content...]
‚îå‚îÄ ü§ñ AI insight
‚îî‚îÄ "Revenue growth signals positive market positioning."
```

#### üöÄ **Benefits**
- **Predictable UX**: Always 0 or 1 insight per segment
- **Complete Context**: API receives full segment content for better analysis
- **Simple State Management**: No complex counting or throttling logic
- **Clean Visual Design**: Straightforward insight display

### Features

- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI generates contextual insights based on conversation content
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging
- **Clean UI**: Simplified insight display without visual clutter
- **Visual Indicators**: AI-generated insights are clearly marked
- **Real-time Integration**: Seamless integration with live transcript flow
